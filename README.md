# Awesome Work from Home

## PULL REQUESTS STRONGLY DESIRED!

Due to the #COVID--19 outbreak, a bunch of companies and workers are about to have their first experience working from home.

Now is a great time for companies outside the IT sector to embrace this culture change, hopefully permanently. 
Because working from home is great:

* It saves companies costs.
* It reduces liabilities. 
* It's better for the environment. 
* It gives people greater autonomy and makes them happier. 


It turns out sitting in traffic for two hours a day can be quite a drag. Who knew! But the best kept secret? 

### It makes people a hell of a lot more productive. 

The evidence is strong that open plan offices are simply far less optimal. In fact, if you are a new work-from-homer, you actually need to be careful that you don't overwork. 
Try to create a dedicated space in your home just for work so that you can leave work and enjoy your evenings. 

#### How Companies can be successful in WFH

Work from Home has been a big success in the IT industry for almost 20 years. Why this industry and not others? Probably because software engineers love building tools that build better tools. We make software that tracks our progress towards our work, that allows us to learn from our mistakes, innovate and create newer more efficient processes with minimal overhead. But you don't need to be a software engineer to do that. Because there is a hell of alot of software out there that we made that you can use for free.

So to recap on how to be successful:

* Have clear goals.
* Use lots of software, preferably that you can change or pay someone to change to make it do what you want.
* Collects metrics and data about your work processes, and if a process or app is broken somehow, pay someone to fix it. 

Doing something specialized? You might want to look up one of the tens of thousands of SAAS companies out there. For common stuff?

Note for contributors:
For the moment this repo is concerned with turnkey solutions that will fit under a SSO / federated login system.
So the auth field should be PAM, OpenID Connect, LDAP or Nonce.
